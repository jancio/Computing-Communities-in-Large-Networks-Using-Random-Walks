# Computing Communities in Large Networks Using Random Walks

This project implements the paper [1] that proposes a random-walk based algorithm Walktrap to efficiently find clusters in graphs. 
Also, I add extensive comparison tests with other algorithms and results from experiments on randomly-generated as well as real-world networks. 
One additional community detection algorithm and two real-world networks beyond the scope of the original paper are considered.
